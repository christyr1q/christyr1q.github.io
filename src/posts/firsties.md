Here's a little blog associated with mousebird consulting.  This won't be high traffic.

I'm contemplating a series of posts on an open source project I'm working.  The project's interesting enough to attract some attention, but needs a little marketing.  
When the project releases, I'm planning to sign up for one of those guest blogger spots on a developer site.

For now, I think I'll post on a few random topics related to computational geometry and ios development, just to provide a little background reading.
