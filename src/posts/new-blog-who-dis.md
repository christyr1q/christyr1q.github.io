Hey, isn't it cool when someone you follow posts a long article about their new blog technology?  Yeah, so this is mine.  Except it's not long.

The old blog was hosted on a Google property they bought long ago and presumably use to harvest our delicious analytics.  But otherwise is kind of meh.

So naturally we had to redo it all.  Why?  Because, That's why.  Are you new to technology?

### mousebird site

We've merged the main mousebird site with the blog.  The old site was about 3 pages you'll only look at if you're going to hire us.  The new one is... also 3 pages you'll only look at etc... but the blog is here also.  People do use the blog, so that's cool.

We've moved away from a Jekyll based thing that used to work with github and then kinda didn't and had to be run on its own.  Now we've done a JAMStack kind of thing hosted on github, but published on netlify using 11ty.  *The previous sentence will firmly identify the time period as 2020 to 2021.*

### WhirlyGlobe Site

Obviously this wasn't worth the effort just for the mousebird site and blog.  We're going to try to redo the WhirlyGlobe site and make it easier to publish and update tutorials.

People do use the blog, but they really, really use the tutorials.  Well, the first few tutorials, actually.  I guess maybe we do want some analytics after all.  Huh.

Anyway, keep on reading the blog.  Over here now.  But otherwise pretty similar.
