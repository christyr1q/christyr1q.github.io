There are currently two github repos for WhirlyGlobe-Maply. The [main one](https://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe) and the one for version 3.0. We're merging them. 

 Version 3.0 was developed in private for sponsors and then released publicly. That caused exactly as much trouble as I expected. We did get Metal support on iOS and a really nice Android version. Worth it! 

###  WhirlyGlobe-Maply Versions

Not everyone wants to upgrade to 3.x right now, so we got you covered on 2.x.

The current 2.x version is 2.6.6. The tag is v2.6.6 and you can use that directly in Cocoapods or whatever your favorite system may be. There may be additional v2.6.x versions. Just look at the tags.

We're going to tag v3.0 on the main repo as well, but you probably want to use 3.1 which we'll be releasing shortly onto master and develop branches.

Going forward, master will be the stable one and use develop if we tell you to (or if you're feeling daring).

### Tutorials

I almost forgot. The [tutorials](https://mousebird.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/tutorial/) have been updated for 3.0!

Android is new. Lots of stuff changed on the Android side of things. iOS has been mostly updated. If you find problems with either, let us know.
