### Client Apps

At mousebird consulting, we've worked on a whole bunch of iOS and Android apps.  Sometimes we do just the geospatial interfaces, other times we write the whole app.  The best way to judge the quality of our work is to check out some of our favorites.

{{ imgctl.appInstance('app-dark-sky.png', title = 'Dark Sky',
content = "Dark Sky is a favorite weather app of its users. Not only will it tell when it's going to rain, it'll show you beautiful animated weather and temperature data. We did the interactive globe.
