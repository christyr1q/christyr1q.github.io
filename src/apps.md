### Client Apps

At mousebird consulting, we've worked on a whole bunch of iOS and Android apps.  Sometimes we do just the geospatial interfaces, other times we write the whole app.  The best way to judge the quality of our work is to check out some of our favorites.

#### NATS Airspace Explorer

Airspace Explorer is a flight tracking and airspace education app developed by the National Air Traffic Control System of the UK.  It displays real time air traffic for the entire world, with a focus on the UK and Europe.  With a lot auxiliary information in addition the the real time it makes a great educational app.

What can you say about this one? It's National Geographic World Atlas. We did the globe for version 4.0. In addition to using our WhirlyGlobe-Maply toolkit, we did a lot of custom work to get that NatGeo look and feel.

This app is used by utilities to manage their activities in the field.  It pairs an intelligent offline syncing system with some rather challenging maps and a very customizable display system.  We did the map, of course, and some of the database work.
